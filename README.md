## Install

```bash
$ npm install -g emojipacks
```

or

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:lambtron/emojipacks-cli.git
$ cd emojipacks-cli
$ make

## Usage

There is only one command:

..and it'll ask you a few questions:

```bash

```

..and let it work its magic:

```

Note that the emoji pack to upload can be a path to a yaml file on your machine or a URL like [http://www.emojipacks.com/packs/food.yaml](http://www.emojipacks.com/packs/food.yaml).

## Emoji Yaml File

Also note that the yaml file must be formatted as such:

```yaml
title: food
emojis:
  - name: apple
    src: http://i.imgur.com/Rw0Vlda.png
  - name: applepie
    src: http://i.imgur.com/g4RU1fM.png
```

..with the `src` pointing to an image file. According to Slack:

- Square images work best
- Image can't be larger than 128px in width or height
- Image must be smaller than 64K in file size
